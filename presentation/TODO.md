Task: Transfer the writeup into this presentation. For starters, keep everything.

Constraints:
- Do not use any animations. Static slides. They can look nice, but don't make them reveal slowly.
- Make the presentation look nice. Generally, try to conform to the slides.tex template file from an old seminar paper of mine.
- Put inline text on separate slides. We will talk about what to keep and what to summarize etc later.
- Strictly copy information. Do not change the formatting or notation and fix no mistakes! Purely copy and make it look good and ergonomical. Keep the order the same.
- Split theorems with multiple items into separate slides, so if possible figure, statement and proof are on the same slide or at least close to each other.
- Keep citations in the presentation
- Please keep the chapters structure in the presentation too.
- Don't copy code that is commented out currently.
- Once you're done, I will ask follow ups and tell you to modify something.
    In that case, first diff against the HEAD of the repository to see what I changed in the writeup and want you to copy to the presentation. 
    Don't guess what I changed, check!
