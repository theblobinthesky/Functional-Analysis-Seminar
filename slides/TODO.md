Task: Transfer the writeup in writeup/writeup.tex into the slides in slides/slides.tex. For starters, keep all the definitions, corollaries, theorems, revisions etc. - everything.

Constraints:
- Do not use any animations. Static slides. They can look nice, but don't make them reveal slowly.
- Make the presentation look nice. Generally, try to conform to the slides.tex template file from an old seminar paper of mine.
- Put inline text on separate slides. We will talk about what to keep and what to summarize etc later.
- Strictly copy information. Do not change the formatting or notation and fix no mistakes! Purely copy and make it look good and ergonomical. Keep the order the same.
- Split theorems with multiple items into separate slides, so if possible figure, statement and proof are on the same slide or at least close to each other.
- Keep citations in the presentation
- Please keep the chapters structure in the presentation too.
- Don't copy code that is commented out currently.
- Once you're done, I will ask follow ups and tell you to modify something.
    In that case, first diff against the HEAD of the repository to see what I changed in the writeup and want you to copy to the presentation. 
    Don't guess what I changed, check!
- If the theorem and proof are small, put them on the same slide.
- Don't the long winded explanations in prosa between blocks such as theorems and definitions.
- Even if statement and proof cannot fit on a page, don't break up the statement or the proof unnecessarily across pages. Only split up if something actually overflows.
- Title texts such as "Dual Operators" need to have white foreground color as their text color is otherwise the same as the background card color.
- The section and subsections should not have a title. Indicate the section in the footer.
- Any *pure* revision theorems are not presented with a proof or proof idea!
- The last page of the presentation must show a "Summary" page rather than a stupid meaningless "Any questions?" page.
- The abstract is not in the presentation.
- If two revision theorems are on consequtive slides, pack them into one slide if not overflow occurs.
- When you split an example or similar blocks across pages, the number cannot increase e.g. *no* Example 6, Example 7, Example 8.
