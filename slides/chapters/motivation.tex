\begin{frame}{Motivation}
    The goal of dual- or adjoint operators is to generalize the notion of an adjoint matrix
    (often denoted as $A^T$ over \reals\ or $A^H$ over \complexes)
    to operators on normed \reals or \complexes vector spaces.

    We will cover the following topics:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The operator $\cdot^H$ is linear and isometric wrt. the spectral norm.
        \item The fundamental theorem of linear algebra (Gilbert Strang) or rank-nullity theorem: \\
            $(\im A)^\perp = \ker A^H$.
        \item TODO Add more
    \end{itemize}
